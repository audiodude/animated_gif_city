Animated GIF City
=================

HTML5 animated GIF generator using Processing.js

The idea is to use some of my Processing creations as backgrounds for
so called ["image macros"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro).

It will be a single page HTML5 application that draws the preview on
a <canvas> and then renders the same exact canvas as an animated GIF
that can be downloaded.
